# Chapter 02: JavaScript Development Tools  
Recommended tools are  
+ git: version control   
+ terminal   
+ npm: package management by means of Node   
  - 2 levels: global and local  
  - global packages are usually command-line tools   
  - local packages are project specific  
  - package installation by `npm istall`  
  - dependencies called module of the project are recorded in `package.json` in the project root  
  - 2 kinds of dependencies: regular and dev, where dev isn't necessary for running the app  
  - `npm install` with flag `--save`/`--saveDev` to add dep record to `package.json`  
+ babel: transcompilers to translate ES6 to ES5
