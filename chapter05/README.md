# Chapter 05. Expressions and Operators  

+ An expression is a special kind of statement that evaluates to a value.  
+ An assignment is itself an expression  
+ 3 kinds of expressions:  
  - operator expressions: operator+operands  
  - identifier expressions: a variable or constant  
  - literal expressions  

## Operators  
an expression results in a value; an operator produces a value  

## Arithmetic Operators  

operator | description | example 
---------|-------------|---------
\+        | Addition (also string concatenation) | 3+2 //5
\-        | Subtraction | 3-2 // 1
/        | Division | 3/2 //1
\*        | Multiplication | 3*2 //6
%        | Remainder | 3%2 //1
\-        | Unary negation | -x // negative x; if x is 5, -x will be -5
\+        | Unary plus | // if x is not a number, this will attempt conversion
\++       | Pre-increment | ++x // increments x by one, and evaluates to the new value
\++       | Post-increment | x++ // increments x by one, and evaluates to value of x before the increment
\--       | Pre-decrement | --x // decrements x by one, and evaluates to the new value
\--       | Post-decrement | x-- // decrements x by one, and evaluates to value of x before the decrement

## Operator precedence  
+ 56 operators grouped into 19 **precedence levels**  
+ Operators with a higher precedence are performed before operators with a lower precedence.  
+ Operators at the same precedence level are either evaluated right to left (e.g. multiplication and divison)  or left to right (e.g. assignment).  

## Comparison operators  
3 kinds: strict equality, abstract (or loose) equality, and relational  

type | definition | symbols 
---------|------------|---------
strictly equal | 2 values refer to the same object, or if they are the same type and have the same value (for primitive types). | `===`/`!==` for equality/inequality  
abstract equal | 2 values refer to the same object (so far, so good) or if they can be *coerced into having the same value*. | `==`/`!=` for equality/inequality  
relational operators | compare values in relation to one another, and they only make sense for data types that have a natural ordering | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`  

## Comparing numbers  
+ `NaN` is not equal to anything, including itself (that is, `NaN === NaN` and `NaN == NaN` are both false  
+ `isNaN(x)` will return true if `x` is `NaN` and `false` otherwise  
+ for fractional numbers, check for "closeness" (absolute difference within `Number.EPSILON`) by relational operators  

## String concatenation  
+ both addition and concatenation are evaluated from left to right.  
+ JS examines each pair of operands from left to right, and if either operand is a string, it assumes string concatenation  

## Logical oeprators  
subject to boolean values (`true`/`false`)  
### truthy and falsy values  
falsy values: `undefined`, `null`, `false`, `0`, `NaN` and `''` (empty string)  
### AND, OR and NOT  
+ AND as conjunction: true iff both operands are true  
+ OR as disjunction: true if either operand is true  
+ NOT as negation  
+ XOR (exclusive OR): false if both operands are true/false, equvilent to expression `(x || y) && (x !== y)`  
### Short-circuit evaluation  
+ `x && y`: y won't be evaluated if `x` is false  
+ `x || y`: y won't be evaluated if `x` is true  
### Logical Operators with Nonboolean Operands  
If you are using boolean operands, the logical operators always return booleans. If youâ€™re not, however, the value that determined the outcome gets returned  
### Conditional Operator  
`x ? y:z`: return `y` if `x` is true, and `z` otherwise  
### Comma Operator  
evaluates two expressions and returns the result of the second one, e.g.,  
`x = (1,2)` will assign `x` as 2  

## Group operator  
### Bitwise operators  
+ Bitwise operators treat their operands as 32-bit signed integers in two's complement format  
+ perform logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) on every individual bit in an integer  
### `typeof` operator  
+ def: returns a string representing the type of its operand  
+ one quirk: `typeof null` returns `object`  
### `void` operator  
evaluate its operand and then return undefined  
### assignment operators  
+ plain assignment operator: `=`  
+ compound operator: perform an operation and assignment in one step, e.g., `*=` (`x*=2` is equal to `x = x*2`)  

## Destructing assignment  
+ enable us to take an object or an array, and "destructure" it into individual variables.  
+ take all the remaining elements and put those in a new array with the **spread operator (...)**  
```javascript
constarr=[1,2,3,4,5];
let [x, y, ...rest] = arr;
x; // 1
y; // 2
rest; // [3, 4, 5]
```
+ Array destructuring makes it easy to swap the values of variables: `[a, b] = [b, a]`  

## Object and Array Operators  

operator | description 
---------|-------------
.   | Member access
[]  | Computed member access 
in  | Property existence operator 
new | Object instantiation operator 
instanceof | Prototype chain test operator 
... | Spread operator
delete | Delete operator

## Expressions in Template Strings  
`` let hello = `${x - y}` ``  

## Expressions and Control Flow Patterns  
+ `if...else` Statements to Conditional Expressions  
```javascript
if(condition)
  statement1
else 
  statement2
```
to `condition ? statement1:statement2;`  
+ `if` Statements to Short-Circuited Logical `OR` Expressions  
`if(!option) options={};` to `options = options || {};`
